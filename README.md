## About The Project

This project showcases a fine-tuned Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that has been specifically trained to understand a 180-degree rotation. Unlike a standard VAE where rotating the latent space produces a scrambled, unrecognizable image, this model learns to associate a 180-degree rotation of a latent vector with a 180-degree rotation of the corresponding output image, without forgetting 0 degree rotation reconstruction.

The core of this experiment is a custom training objective that teaches the model this specific geometric property.

### Key Features & Methodology
* **Base Model:** The VAE was extracted from the popular **`Disty0/SoteMix`** model, which is based on Stable Diffusion v1.5.
* **Custom Loss Function:** The model was fine-tuned using a dual-objective loss function composed of:
    1.  **Reconstruction Loss:** A standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to ensure the VAE can accurately reconstruct images.
    2.  **Rotation Loss:** A MSE loss that explicitly penalizes the model if decoding a 180째-rotated latent vector does not produce a 180째-rotated version of the original image.
* **Training Environment:** All data collection, model training, and testing were performed using Google Colab.

## Results & Verification

The model successfully learned the desired rotational property. This was quantitatively verified by performing a round-trip transformation:
1.  An image is encoded into a latent vector.
2.  The latent vector is flipped/rotated 180째.
3.  The modified latent is decoded, producing a rotated image.
4.  The final image is rotated back 180째.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the final image and the original input was exceptionally low (**~0.0023**), proving that the transformation is nearly perfectly flipped and that the model has learned the intended rotational equivariance.

Due to how GitHub renders (or fails to render) notebooks with interactive widget outputs, it's recommended to view the project notebook using nbviewer.
